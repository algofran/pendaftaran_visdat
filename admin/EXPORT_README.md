## Technical Details

### Dependencies:
- **SheetJS (xlsx)**: Client-side Excel generation
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI components and styling
- **Font Awesome**: Icons

- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

### Performance:
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Client-side processing reduces server load
- Optimized column widths for readability

## Error Handling

### Common Issues:
1. **No Data**: Exports template with headers
2. **Database Error**: Shows error message to user
3. **Network Error**: Displays connection failure message
4. **Authentication**: Redirects to login if session expired

### Troubleshooting:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify PHP error logs for server-side issues
- Ensure database connection is working
- Test with `admin/test-export.php` for isolated testing

## Security Considerations

### Authentication:
- Requires admin session to access export functionality
- API endpoint validates user authentication
- No sensitive data exposure in URLs

### File URLs:
- Uses absolute URLs for maximum compatibility
- Files served from protected upload directory
- Upload directory has proper security headers

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Filtered Export**: Export only filtered/selected records
2. **Custom Fields**: Allow admin to choose which columns to export
3. **PDF Export**: Alternative export format
4. **Scheduled Exports**: Automatic periodic exports
5. **Email Export**: Send exported file via email
6. **Data Validation**: Highlight incomplete applications
7. **Charts/Graphics**: Include summary statistics

### Performance Optimizations:
1. **Pagination**: For very large datasets
2. **Background Processing**: For large exports
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently exported data
4. **Compression**: Reduce file size for large exports
